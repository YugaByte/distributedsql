The first Spanner paper published at OSDI 2012 focused on the systems aspects such as scalability, automatic sharding, fault tolerance, consistent replication, external consistency, and wide-area distribution. A subsequent paper in SIGMOD 2017 highlighted the database DNA of Spanner. This presentation builds on that second paper; we describe distributed SQL query execution in the presence of resharding, query restarts upon transient failures, range extraction that drives query routing and index seeks, and the improved blockwise columnar storage format. We touch upon the common SQL dialect shared with other systems at Google.",

Distributed SQL databases are a new breed that operate on a cluster of nodes. These databases have fundamentally different architectures, requiring a different benchmarking methodology. For example, the network latency between the nodes begins to dominate the write latency since data is replicated synchronously. Understanding the impact of network latency is critical to getting optimal performance. In this talk, we will look at the transactional cloud serving benchmark or TCSB framework built to benchmark distributed, transactional databases, and the results of benchmarking a few such DBs.",
