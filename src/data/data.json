This is primarily being done to accelerate software delivery, ensure application portability and/or to satisfy security or compliance requirements. These cloud-native requirements are being similarly extended to the underlying database infrastructure that applications rely on. In this keynote, Jame Watters, SVP of Strategy at Pivotal, will walk us through the evolution, benefits and challenges that enterprise IT faces in transforming how it delivers applications, security, automation and data in a cloud-native first world."

Cloud-native patterns allow developers to run their compute on infrastructure that is also spread globally. However, building these applications involves putting together a lot of different tools and patterns which makes it hard to move fast and slows down delivery. I will introduce GraphQL as a modern API layer that is helping developers accelerate product delivery and the patterns / challenges in making GraphQL work with distributed SQL. Iâ€™m going to discuss architectures, recipes and show you demos of a modern and seamless developer experience for application developers.",

          "sortOrder": 4.5,
          "timeSlot": 6,
          "talkAbstract":"Without transactional tables, the global indexes can get easily out of sync with their data tables in Apache Phoenix. Transactional tables require a separate transaction manager, have some restrictions and performance penalties, are still in beta. This technical talk lays out a design to have strongly consistent global indexes without the need for an external transaction manager. In addition to having strongly consistent indexing, the proposed design aims to have minimal impact on read performance. In Phoenix, global indexing is implemented using a separate table for each secondary index of a table. Updating a table with one or more global index requires updating multiple table regions likely distributed over multiple region servers. Translating a single table update operation into a multi-table write operation poses consistency issues as Phoenix does not provide a reliable multi-table update capability without using transactional tables. Although updating multiple tables (in our case, a data table and its indexes) atomically requires implementing a form of two-phase commit protocol, we have observed that achieving strongly consistent global indexing does not require implementing a general-purpose transaction capability. Another important observation is that HBase is a log-structured data store, that is, updates are never done in place. In these systems, writes are much faster when compared to in-place update systems because random writes are handled as fast as sequential writes. This allows us to add an extra write phase during updates without severely impacting the write performance, which simplifies the overall design. In this talk, we will present the details of the proposed design, the proof of its correctness, and our performance analysis and test results.",

A subsequent paper in SIGMOD 2017 highlighted the database DNA of Spanner. This presentation builds on that second paper; we describe distributed SQL query execution in the presence of resharding, query restarts upon transient failures, range extraction that drives query routing and index seeks, and the improved blockwise columnar storage format.
