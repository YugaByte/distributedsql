As organizations undergo digital transformations, users responsible for data workloads are often tasked with coordinating these legacy and cloud native systems concurrently. The growing number and complexity of these workloads causes teams to require standardization layer around for maintainability, reusability, and extendability.<br /><br />This talk will showcase how data platform engineers can provide a standard template for users to perform business-specific actions with Apache Airflow to replicate Postgres data to a distributed Yugabyte instance. It will end with a brief overview of the Airflow Provider framework."

The consequences of applying changes too slowly or, worse, breaking something at internet-scale are just too high.<br /><br />Fortunately, we can learn from lessons the DevOps movement have taught us. DevOps practitioners have been dealing with internet-scale applications for some time and we can apply what they've learned to the database to ultimately allow teams to operate safely at internet-scale while still meeting business expectations for internet speed when delivering new functionality.<br /><br />This session will discuss:<br /><ul><br /><li>The challenges of schema management in a distributed SQL database</li><br /><li>Balancing those challenges with delivery speed and safety</li><br /><li>Example workflows using Liquibase to perform schema updates on a distributed SQL database</li></ul>"

Live queries are nothing but querying the backing database at a fixed time interval. Obviously, as the number of subscriptions increases, it increases the query load on the database. Any other DML operations on a database will strain the resources of the monolithic single-node database.<br /><br />In this talk, we will walk through steps for implementing resilient and scalable GraphQL subscriptions using Hasura Engine and YugabyteDB on Kubernetes. Components of the stack, including the database, can be linearly scaled independently of each other. In addition to linear scalability, GraphQL subscriptions will inherently become resilient against outages due to the fault tolerance and HA capabilities of distributed SQL databases."

But ensuring scalability while rapidly solving complex business problems simultaneously is hard.<br /><br />The answer lies in the architecture and the choice of components. For any given stack, there are three components, the API layer, database, and the business logic. The magic sauce, which weâ€™ll explore in this talk, is how to combine these three components into an architecture that scales easily and at the same time boosts developer productivity.<br /><br />Once we have the architecture that helps us developers build quickly, weâ€™ll discuss how the choice of GraphQL/Hasura (API) & Distributed SQL/Yugabyte (Database) & serverless functions (business logic) can solve the scalability problem out-of-the-box.<br /><br />By the end of this talk, I hope to show you how you can have your cake and eat it too, aka build stuff fast and have it scale out automatically without any dev effort."
