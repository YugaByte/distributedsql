Over the past few years, we have seen an increasing number of customer requests for distributed storage that offers SQL-like features such as distributed transactions and secondary indexing, while achieving scalability of a NoSQL database. To address these requirements, we built dedicated middleware on top of HBase that provide these additional functionalities. This talk presents the evolution of Pinterest’s online storage services (with a focus around HBase), the challenges we face today and our early exploration of a distributed SQL database."

Admiral helps online publishers engage with visitors through adblock recovery, paid subscriptions, privacy and consent management, and more. Our dataset is large and complex. The previous NoSQL database couldn’t scale, so we moved to distributed SQL. Our Go application runs in Google Cloud across 5 regions in 3 continents. This geo-distributed architecture is powered by a single YugabyteDB cluster that delivers an average global read latency of 3ms! In this talk, we’ll look at how distributed SQL can be deployed on modern cloud infrastructure to provide a scalable, resilient, low latency, fully consistent data service."
