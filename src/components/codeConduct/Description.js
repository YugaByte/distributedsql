          The Distributed SQL Summit is an online, virtual conference. All conference attendees, speakers, and staff attending or partaking in our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.

          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or being permanently removed and blocked from the event platform.

        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately through the help desk.

          We expect participants to follow these rules during the online conference and workshops and throughout virtual networking areas. We value your attendance.
